        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated Software Engineering and Information Science and Technology student at Penn State University and enjoy utilizing technological solutions to real-world problems. I have a strong foundation in programming, software development methodologies, and data structures. I am eager to use these skills in a dynamic, innovative team-based environment.

Throughout my studies, I have gained hands-on experience in C, C++, C#, Java, Python, and other languages. I perform best on collaborative projects and enjoy solving complex problems as a team. This is shown in my coursework and personal projects alike.

I am actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute my technical skills and enthusiasm for software development while learning and growing in the field. I am excited to connect with professionals in the industry and explore where I can add value.

I am looking forward to connecting and discussing potential opportunities!</p>
