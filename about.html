        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>One of my greatest passions is scouting. Being a scout has taught me valuable skills such as leadership, teamwork, and outdoor survival. I enjoy participating in camping trips, community service projects, and honing my skills in nature.</p>
        <p>In addition to scouting, I love exploring the outdoors and spending time with friends and family. Whether it's hiking, fishing, or just enjoying a day in nature, these experiences help me recharge and inspire my creative endeavors.</p>
